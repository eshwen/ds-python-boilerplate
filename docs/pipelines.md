# Pipelines

Several pipelines are included to execute automatically on various triggers:

* [build.yml](https://github.com/eshwen/ds-python-boilerplate/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) (to build the
  project)
* [dependabot.yml](https://github.com/eshwen/ds-python-boilerplate/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml) (to check for
  updates and vulnerabilities in dependencies, the Docker container, and the other pipelines)

TODO: Add documentation and CodeQL pipelines. Flesh out build and dependabot more (coverage, etc., and paths to scripts
for local running).
